# Customer_churn_prediction
#ABSTRACT Customer churn is a major challenge faced by businesses across various industries. Losing customers can have a significant impact on a business's revenue and growth. Therefore, predicting customer churn and taking proactive measures to prevent it is crucial for businesses to maintain customer loyalty and revenue. The project "Predicting Customer Churn" is a data science project aimed at developing a model that can predict which customers are likely to churn or discontinue their subscription or services. The project utilizes various data mining techniques such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn. The project begins with collecting and cleaning customer data, such as demographic information, transaction history, and service usage data. The data is then explored to identify any patterns or trends that could indicate customer churn. This is done using exploratory data analysis techniques such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and correlation analysis. Feature engineering techniques are then applied to extract meaningful features from the data, such as the customer's tenure, usage patterns, and payment history. Feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance, and domain knowledge are used to select the most important features that contribute to predicting customer churn. Next, machine learning algorithms are trained on the labeled data to predict customer churn. Various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and neural networks are used to train and evaluate the models. The model is evaluated on a test dataset to measure its performance. The best-performing model is selected for deployment and integrated with the business's existing system. The results of this project can help businesses to identify customers who are likely to churn and take proactive measures to retain them.

#DATASET DESCRIPTION

In this Telecom Customer Churn, each row represents a customer with a unique customer ID and each column has different information about the customer. The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).

The dataset includes information like:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn. Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies. Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
